# üèóÔ∏è How to Use CSS

## Applying CSS to HTML
1.  Link the CSS file: Ensure the CSS file is correctly linked in the HTML file within the   
  <head> section. This is done using the <link> tag:
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css">

## 2 Class and ID Selectors: Apply styles to HTML elements using class and ID selectors.

### Class Selector: 
* Applied to multiple elements using the class attribute.

### ID Selector: 
*  Applied to a single element using the id attribute.

# Positioning:

## 3 Relative Positioning: 
### * Use the position: 
  * Relative; property to position an element relative to its normal position.

### Absolute Positioning: 
  * Use the position: absolute; property to position an element relative     to its nearest positioned ancestor.


# Example

## Relative Positioning:

# relative-box-2 {
    position: relative;
    left: 200px;
}

## Absolute Positioning:

# absolute-box-2 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 700px;
}
